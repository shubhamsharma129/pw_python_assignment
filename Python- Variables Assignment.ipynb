    "Q5. Using an example, explain how the variables in python are dynamic in nature.\n",
    "Ans.5) In Python, variables are dynamic in nature,\n",
    "which means they can hold values of different types and their values can be changed during the execution of the program.\n",
    "This flexibility allows for more dynamic and versatile programming. \n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate the dynamic nature of variables in Python:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Dynamic variable assignment\n",
    "x = 5  # Assigning an integer value to variable x\n",
    "print(x)  # Output: 5\n",
    "\n",
    "x = \"Hello\"  # Assigning a string value to variable x\n",
    "print(x)  # Output: Hello\n",
    "\n",
    "x = [1, 2, 3]  # Assigning a list value to variable x\n",
    "print(x)  # Output: [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Dynamic variable type conversion\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "print(type(x))  # Output: <class 'int'>\n",
    "\n",
    "x = str(x)  # Converting x to a string\n",
    "print(type(x))  # Output: <class 'str'>\n",
    "\n",
    "# Dynamic variable modification\n",
    "x = 5\n",
    "print(x)  # Output: 5\n",
    "\n",
    "x = x + 3  # Modifying the value of x\n",
    "print(x)  # Output: 8\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we initially assign the value 5 to the variable `x`, and it behaves as an integer. However, we can later assign a string value (\"Hello\") and a list value ([1, 2, 3]) to the same variable `x`. Python allows us to dynamically change the type and value of the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we can dynamically convert the type of a variable using functions like `str()`. In the example, we convert the variable `x` from an integer to a string using the `str()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, variables can be modified dynamically by performing operations on their values. In the example, we increment the value of `x` by 3 using the `+` operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dynamic nature of variables in Python provides flexibility and makes it easier to work with different data types and modify values as needed throughout the program execution.\n",
